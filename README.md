  <h3>Proxie servers</h3>
    <body>
      <p> Proxie servers, from what I can tell are basically a sort of "checkpoint" that all internet traffic has to pass through before it can get either to another specified server, from a computer, or vice versa. Therefore, it can be used for both secutrity, and for spying on internet traffic, as you would be able to see their server requests.</p>
