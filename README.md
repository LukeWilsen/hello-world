  <h3>Proxie servers</h3>
    <body>
      <p> Proxie servers, from what I can tell are basically a sort of "<em>checkpoint<em>" that all internet traffic has to pass through before it can get either to another specified server, from a computer, or vice versa. Therefore, it can be used for both secutrity, and for spying on internet traffic, as you would be able to see their server requests.</p>

  <h4>Commands/Format</h4>
  <body>
    <p>These are the things that I would like to have all in one place b/c they're kind hard to remember.</p>
    <br>
    <p>First off, embedding links. Format = (<a href="...."> wormhole text </a>) but with this, there must be somewhere else in the document with the "...." or else the code won't work b/c there <strong>isn't an end destination</strong>. To give an endpoint, Format = (<div id="endpoint">)
